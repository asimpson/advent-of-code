;; To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

;; For example:

;; aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
;; aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
;; aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.
;; The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?

;; --- Part Two ---

;; For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.

;; For example:

;; abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
;; abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
;; a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
;; iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
;; oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.
